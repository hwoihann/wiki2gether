We’ll also see why project directory organization isn’t just about being tidy, but is essential to the way by which tasks are automated across large numbers of files (which we routinely do in bioinformatics)</p> <hr /> <ul> <li>Project Directories and Directory Structures</li> <li>Project Documentation</li> <li>Use Directories to Divide Up Your Project into Subprojects</li> <li>Organizing Data to Automate File Processing Tasks</li> <li>Markdown for Project Notebooks</li> <li>Markdown Formatting Basics</li> <li>Using Pandoc to Render Markdown to HTML</li> </ul> <hr /> <h2 id="1-project-directories-and-directory-structures">1. Project Directories and Directory Structures</h2> <p>Regardless of the organization scheme, a good bioinformatician will always document everything extensively and use clear filenames that can be parsed by a computer, two points we’ll come to in a bit.</p> <p>When in doubt, explicit is always better than implicit when it comes to filenames, documentation, and writing code.</p> <p><strong>always use relative paths</strong> In contrast, absolute paths rely on your particular user account and directory structures details above the project directory level (not good). Using absolute paths leaves your work less portable between collaborators and decreases reproducibility.</p> <p>mkdir data mkdir data/seqs scripts analysis</p> <hr /> <p>This is a sensible project layout scheme. Here, data/ contains all raw and intermediate data. As we’ll see, data-processing steps are treated as separate subprojects in this data/ directory. I keep general project-wide scripts in a scripts/ directory. If scripts contain many files (e.g., multiple Python modules), they should reside in their own subdirectory. Isolating scripts in their own subdirectory also keeps project directories tidy while developing these scripts (when they produce test output files). Bioinformatics projects contain many smaller analyses—for example, analyzing the quality of your raw sequences, the aligner output, and the final data that will produce figures and tables for a paper. I prefer keeping these in a separate analysis/ directory, as it allows collaborators to see these high-level analyses without having to dig deeper into subproject directories.</p> <h2 id="2-project-documentation">2. Project Documentation</h2> <p>There’s a vast amount of lurking complexity in bioinformatics work: complex workflows, multiple files, countless program parameters, anddifferent software versions. The best way to prevent this complexity from causingproblems is to document everything extensively.</p> <ul> <li>Document your methods and workflows This should include full command lines (copied and pasted) that are run through the shell that generate data or intermediate results. Even if you use the default values in software, be sure to write these values down; later versions of the program may use different default values.</li> </ul> <p><strong>In general, any command that produces results used in your work needs to be documented somewhere.</strong></p> <h3 id="track-where-when-and-how">Track: Where, When, and How</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Document the origin of all data in your project directory “Data” doesn’t just refer to your project’s experimental data—it’s any data that programs use to create output. This includes files your collaborators send you from their separate analyses, gene annotation tracks, reference genomes, and so on. Need to keep track of where data was downloaded from, who gave it to you, and any other relevant information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document when you downloaded data It’s important to include when the data was downloaded, as the external data source (such as a website or server) might change in the future.</p> </li> <li> <p>Record data version information Many databases have explicit release numbers, version numbers, or names (e.g., TAIR10 version of genome annotation for Arabidopsis thaliana, or Wormbase release WS231 for Caenorhabditis elegans). It’s important to record all version information in your documentation, including minor version numbers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Describe how you downloaded the data For example, did you use MySQL to download a set of genes? Or the UCSC Genome Browser? These details can be useful in tracking down issues like when data is different between collaborators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document the versions of the software that you ran This may seem unimportant, but remember the example from “Reproducible Research” on page 6 where my colleagues and I traced disagreeing results down to a single piece of software being updated. These details matter. Good bioinfor‐ matics software usually has a command-line option to return the current version. Software managed with a version control system such as Git has explicit identifi‐ ers to every version, which can be used to document the precise version you ran (we’ll learn more about this in Chapter 5). If no version information is available, a release date, link to the software, and download date will suffice</p> </li> </ul> <p>All of this information is best stored in plain-text README files. Plain text can easily be read, searched, and edited directly from the command line, making it the perfect choice for portable and accessible README files. Where should you keep your README files? A good approach is to keep README files in each of your project’s main directories. These README files don’t necessarily need to be lengthy, but they should at the very least explain what’s in this directory and how it got there. For example, a data/README file would contain metadata about your data files in the data/ directory. Even if you think you could remember all relevant information about your data, it’s much easier just to throw it in a README file (and collaborators won’t have to email you to ask what files are or where they are).</p> <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">touch README data/README</code></p> <h2 id="3-use-directories-to-divide-up-your-project-into-subprojects">3. Use Directories to Divide Up Your Project into Subprojects</h2> <p>ake-home point is: leverage directories to help stay organized</p> <p>Creating directories to logically separate subprojects (e.g., sequencing data quality improvement, aligning, analyzing alignment results, etc.) can simplify complex projects and help keep files organized.</p> <h2 id="4-organizing-data-to-automate-file-processing-tasks">4.
