## Golden rule of Bioinformatics
### Never ever trust your tools (or data)
The easy way to ensure everything is working properly is to adopt a cautious attitude, and check everything between computational steps. Furthermore, you should
approach biological data (either from an experiment or from a database) with a healthy skepticism that there might be something wrong with it.
